# Fantasy-cricket-team-
In this project I have created user interface using Python's PyQt module. Users can create their 11 player fantasy team and their points will be displayed according to their performance.
<br>
Along with PyQt module I have also used Qt designer to arrange the user interface elements like lists,radio buttons,etc.
<br>
Player's performance will be calculated on basis of number of half centuries,centuries,catches,wickets,runs,run-outs,etc scored by them in previous matches.
This data is stored in a SQLite database.
<br>
After selecting 11 players a final score of entire team will be calculated as per player's individual performance.
