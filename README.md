# Fantasy-cricket-team-
In this project I have created user interface using Python's PyQt library. Users can create their 11 player fantasy team and their points will be displayed according to their performance.  
Player's performance will be calculated on basis of number of half centuries,centuries,catches,wickets,runs,run-outs,etc scored by them in previous matches.
This data is stored in a SQLite database.

After selecting 11 players a final score of entire team will be calculated as per player's individual performance.
